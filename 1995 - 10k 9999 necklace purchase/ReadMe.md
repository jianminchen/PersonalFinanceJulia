It is hard for me to admit that I do not have fortune to afford a one-bedroom in the city of Vancouver in 2018. I have to learn what is going on. <br>

I landed in Canada in April 2010. But I did not make any purchase until 2018, the price doubles. The condo is more than $200,000 dollars. I even could not afford to qualify a loan. <br>

In order to understand myself in terms of personal finance, I like to review finance data I have and I like to write something to help myself, push myself to build new habit with discipline and saving and investing. <br>

[Case study: a gold 9999 necklace purchased in 1995](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/12/case-study-gold-999-necklace-purchased.html) is the blog I wrote related to case study of gold 9999 necklace purchase. <br>
