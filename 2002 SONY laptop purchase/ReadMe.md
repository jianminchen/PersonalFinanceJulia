I was so surprised to learn that I purchased a super expensive laptop. I did not fully use the laptop to do all kinds of job from 2002 to 2010. It was the impulsive shopping. 

I still remembered that in 2002 I talked to my friend and told him that I was helping economy recovery. I invited my mom to travel to USA again after I got laidoff and stayed at home as a home maker in 2002, and then I bought most expensive laptop once I went back to FAU for PH.D. program in Sept. 2002. I was lucky to get accepted for Motorola intern program in Sept. 2002. 

I still remembered that in 2010 I did not have any saving left after I spent over 14 years in United States, I put debt on my home equity line with more than $38,000 dollars, and took $17,000 dollar with me to immigrate to Canada. I wrote a blog [Case study: 2010 April 23 $17000 US dollar exchange](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/search?q=case+study+17%2C000+us+dollars).<br>

I like to conduct some personal finance study and understand how I could not build wealth, what was my problems to learn to invest, and be independent and proactive in personal finance. It is a serious topic and very challenge problem for me to solve. 

I wrote a blog with a title: [Case study: a $1800 Sony laptop purchase in 2002](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/12/case-study-1500-sony-laptop-purchase.html).<br>
