One pen, one paper, one diligent heart. Write down all expenses, and then figure out if I can use those money to invest in stock market, real estate, or just park in money market fund. <br>

It does take patience to learn how to do analysis using Excel sheet, and work with pivot table. But the determination to learn the budget, review and audit the expenses are essential skills for a person to learn how to invest money not to spend money. <br>
