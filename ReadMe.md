The repository is only for study and research purpose. I like to share the experience to help those immigrants to learn better about Canadian finance, US recession in 2009, and transition from USA to Canada. 

I had difficulty time to adapt and hop on the opportunity in the city of Vancouver. I had baggages from USA, although at that time I thought that I did right thing in Nov. 2011, actually I missed the opportunity I had in Canada. 

I need to do a few study related to Canada banking comparing to USA banking. I need to write down my questions, and then look up Youtube.com videos, learn a few terms about passive income, and rental income, and all other benefits to have a full time job offer at hand.
