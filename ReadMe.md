**<span style="color:blue">The repository is only for study and research purpose. I like to share the experience to help those immigrants like me to learn better about personal finance, learn better about Canadian finance, US recession in 2009, and transition from USA to Canada. I have very struggle life in my personal finance from 1984 to 2008 and then I like to learn starting from August 2018.</span>** <br>

**Proverb 30:7-9**<br>
I ask two things from you, Lord. Don't refuse me before I die. 8 Keep me from lying and being dishonest. And don't make me either rich or poor; just give me enough food for each day. 9 If I have too much, I might reject you and say, 'I don't know the Lord.' If I am poor, I might steal and disgrace the name of my God.<br>

**Psalm 37:25**<br>

I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging for bread.<br>

**My bible study in Boca Raton home in 2008** <br>
My christian friends in Boca Raton shared the verse with me when I struggled to file the appeal for leave case in Federal court of Canada in 2009. I held a small bible study at my home in Boca Raton, Florida a few weekends in 2009.  

**Luke 18:1-8**
The Parable of the Persistent Widow<br>
1 Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. 2 He said: “In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought. 3 And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’ 4 “For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t fear God or care what people think, 5 yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won’t eventually come and attack me!’ ” 6 And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unjust judge says. 7 And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? 8 I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”

**2009 - 2011 and recession**<br>

I experienced the tough time in USA after 2008. USA was in recesison in 2009, a lot of property in Florida was underwater. I managed to make a living from August 2008 to April 2010, live on savings and with low interest rate of home equity loan. 

I had difficulty time to adapt and hop on the opportunity in the city of Vancouver. Although at that time I thought that I did right thing in Nov. 2011, I got loan approved but I did not take it. Actually I missed the opportunity I had in Canada. 

I need to do a few study related to Canada banking comparing to USA banking. I need to write down my questions, and then look up Youtube.com videos, learn a few terms about passive income, and rental income, and all other benefits to have a full time job offer at hand. 

At that time, following buying low selling high principle, the price was low back in 2011.

**Dec.15 - Dec. 16**<br>

I stayed in my home office the whole weekend. Except cooking, sleep, a few social chat with my roommates. All I did is to review personal finance data, use scanCamera app to document the expenses; I search videos to watch on youtube.com, and then I also chose some good article, books to read. 

It was a marathon, I nonstopped to work on those paper work 48 hours inside my home office. I did not step outside the home. 

I push myself to learn as much as I can. I also write down the content I chose to watch, read and then writes something to share. 

A few blogs can be searched from here.
