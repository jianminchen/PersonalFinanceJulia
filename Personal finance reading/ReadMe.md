It is so challenging for me to start a journey to work on my personal finance. I had over 20 years experience to work and live in north America, however I did not have chance to build wealth and I am still working hard to find solutions for myself. 

One thing is to work on my problem solving skills in terms of personal finance. I like to case study my history of decision making, planning or budget or impulsive shopping, missing annual personal finance work, personal booking and other basic review and audit. 

I also like to watch youtube video on personal finance, money, and then write some blog related to my case study, inspiration from the video teaching. I also like to read more articles related to personal finance.
