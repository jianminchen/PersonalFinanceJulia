Life should be so easy for me since I were a single person, without too much responsibility. I was well educated from 1984 to 1988 and went to top university in China, and then followed another three year master degree study from 1989 to 1992 in Shanghai. I had work experience related to software industry, good mathematics education, I started to study in Florida from 1996 to 1998.  

I made over $110,000 net income from 1999 to 2001. That is the only time in my life I brought home biggest income. 

What I like to do is to analyze things from personal finance. I think if I push myself hard to learn the value of each dollar. If I make so many mistakes in my personal finance, I like to spend some time to review and continue to push myself to do research, learn and help others if I have chance. 

Today it is the first time I read those financial data. I did not keep those bank statements and all returned checks. I did write down by my memory and life stories with my family, friends etc. 

I like to write down some questions to ask myself. 

1. What was the salary before I came to United States? from 1988 to 1998? 
2. What was the financial income from 1996 to 1998?
3. Why did I choose to spend some much money on travel, expenses on my mom and my relatives in China?
4. How do I learn the value of income and the wealth I can create if I invest them into China? 
5. Why I did not purchase a second condo from 2000 to 2001 when I worked in the city of Sunrise?
