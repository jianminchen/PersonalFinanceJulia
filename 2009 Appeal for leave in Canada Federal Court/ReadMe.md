I filed Canada skilled work immigraton case in 2007 by a consultant, and then in January 2018 my case was denied since I did not send in the bank letter with financial statement with more than $10,000 dollars. I got 45 days to turn in and then 30 days extension. The officer sent out the letter in Oct. 2008, and then waited over two months. In January 2009 my case was finalized with denial. 

I had 60 days to file an appeal for leave. I did my own case to file appeal for leave. 

I consulted a few Canadian immigration laywers, I was offered to pay $3500 dollars to handle my case. One lawyer offered me to write a letter and I had to pay $1,000 dollars. 

I was advised by my friend. I do not have money and income at that time, I did file the appeal for leave by myself. I just kept making mistakes all the time until I got approval for the judge for the court date on Sept. 2009. 

I saved the money and only paid efile fee. I will do a case study on this later.
